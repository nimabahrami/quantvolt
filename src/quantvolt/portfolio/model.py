    Invariants enforced at construction (eager boundary validation, ``coding-style.md`` §7):

    - ``npv`` must be finite. A NaN or ±inf NPV would silently poison every downstream
      aggregate (portfolio NPV, VaR loss quantiles), so it is rejected here with a
      :class:`~quantvolt.exceptions.ValidationError` naming ``npv``.
    - ``delta`` is defensively copied: the mapping is snapshot into a fresh ``dict`` at
      construction, so later mutation of the caller's dict cannot reach into this frozen
      value object. The stored copy is treated as immutable by convention from then on —
      nothing in the library writes to it. (``object.__setattr__`` is the sanctioned way
      to assign inside ``__post_init__`` of a frozen dataclass and works with ``slots``.)
    - ``reference_prices`` is defensively copied the same way. It optionally records the
      forward price level ``value_portfolio`` observed for each ``delta`` entry's
      ``(commodity_id, delivery period)`` key, in the same units as that commodity's
      forward curve. ``RiskEngine.apply_scenario`` needs this to correctly scale a
      *relative* (fractional) scenario shock into currency P&L
      (``delta x reference_price x shock`` — see :mod:`quantvolt.risk.scenarios`); a key
      absent from ``reference_prices`` (including an entirely empty mapping, the default)
      falls back to a reference price of ``1.0``, preserving the legacy
      ``delta x shock`` behaviour for hand-built positions that never populate it.
